# Univerity-Of-Berkley
In 1973, the University of California-Berkeley (UC-Berkeley) was sued for sex discrimination. Its admission data showed that men applying to graduate school at UC-Berkley were more likely to be admitted than women.

The graduate schools had just accepted 44% of male applicants but only 35% of female applicants. The difference was so great that it was unlikely to be due to chance.

By looking at the data more closely, you may realize that there is more to the story than meets the eye.
